# Ontologizer
A method of inductively inferring abstractions from unlabeled data with the goal of interpreting internal representations of deep learning models. The goal is to build an "ontological" representation of input data.

The ontology is built by stacking [DeePWAK](https://github.com/kewiechecki/DeePWAK) layers.
